All big music services today use Machine Learning to predict what song to play next for you. This project aims to take it one step further - it should not only _predict_, but also match tempo and mix the next song with the first in a natural sounding, DJ-like transition. 

This is the feature list -

-  Music classification based on mood,
-  Tempo/signature recognition,
-  User preference,
-  Music prediction based on the above.
-  Adding additional beats/drops to a single track based on it's features
-  Mixing the next song with the first, _"like a DJ would"._


**Timeline**

To be decided based on the candidate(s).
