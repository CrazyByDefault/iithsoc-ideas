SmartStor is a project initiated by [@Siddhartha1234](https://github.com/Siddhartha1234) during last year's summer as a part of Lambda team. It provides an interface to share
files virtually across platforms if they are connected on the same network. It uses the concept of just-in-time loading of stored files
to share a huge list of files, stream large media or just load a document and read without occupying any space on the client device and just storing one instance of each file - removing the need to copy across multiple devices. 
Instant share the files virtually and load it whenever you want, and sync the files you need to copy!

The project being huge and targetting multiple platforms is incomplete, lacks proper GUI and many other features. The code written is platform specific and the Android app doesn't have many features and isn't published on play store yet.

SmartStor v2 aims to improve the existing codebase, add proper OS X/ Linux support by making the Node.js code platform-independent, improve/add GUI interface to drag/drop on all platforms, add video support in media streaming, add Document reader, improve file exploring and more!

**Milestones**

**PREPARATION/BONDING**

- Discuss the feasibility of proposed implementation details with the mentor(s). 
- Learn the required skills(if not yet learnt) and add play around with the implementation samples proposed.
- Discuss or test the feasibility of additional features proposed.

**MID-TERM EVALUATION**

- OSX/Linux Support has been added.
- Video streamer has been implemented.
- GUI in Android has been added.

**FINAL-TERM EVALUATION**

- Video streaming support(in a chunk of bytes) has been added.
- Document reader has been implemented.
- All the other additional features have been implemented.
- App has been published to google play and other platform's client has been hosted on website.
