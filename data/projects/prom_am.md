[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus) is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community. It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company.  

The [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) is the part of Prometheus that handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. 

This project aims to improve the currently broken AM UI, make API changes in order to enable more complex filtering queries from the UI, and also fix a number of open issues in AM.
